- Return multiple result named parameters
- Pass by reference, Pass by value
    - Pass by reference changes the orginal value.
      You pass the address (&var) to the function and changes the original value

    - Pass by value does not change the actual value but creates a new one.
      You pass a value in and it gives you a new value, and keep the orginal value intact.
